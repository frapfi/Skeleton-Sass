# Skeleton-Sass
The (un)official Sass Version of Skeleton (2.0.4): A Dead Simple, Responsive Boilerplate for Mobile-Friendly Development

Basically a striped-down version of “Skeleton-Sass” (https://github.com/whatsnewsaes/Skeleton-Sass from Seth Coelen) which is a fork of the Skeleton framework: https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton.

By “striped-down” I mean I only imported the parts which are relevant for the grid and got rid of all the other stuff.
